            <br/>
            I started learning C++ as a programming language in first semester . I had a keen
            interest in solving problems and hence I started with hackerrank and consequently
            shifted to leetcode and gfg for further practice. I have solved upto 1000+ problems on
            DSA till now and participated in several contests. I was also awarded as a Diva winner in one of the
            coding contests held in our college and finalist of Google Girl Hackathon'23.
           <br/>
            I have knowledge of devlopment languages like Javascript and React and have made projects using them. I started
            with basic HTML and then learned CSS for static websites. Then I switched to Javascript 
            and React.
